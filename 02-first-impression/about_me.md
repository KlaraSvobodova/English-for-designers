## About me

Hello, my name is Klára Svobodová, and my nickname is Klárys. So you can call me like that. 

I have been doing graphic design since high school. I graduated from a vocational school with a focus on graphic design. I went to the Michael School and finished last year. I got the title DiS. Graphic Designer. Currently, I am here at VŠKK earning my BcA. 

Also to graphics, I work on Czech floorball development projects. I am an active referee and player... So, if I'm not sitting at the computer at home, I'm somewhere on the sports hall.. I try to find a balance between these two worlds because in graphic world are people usually introvert and when I am on the sports hall i have to be extrovert and strict.

It is good to myself and my health, it is like mental exercise.
