About me

Hello, my name is Klára Svobodová, and my nickname is Klárys. I have been doing graphic design since high school. I graduated from a vocational school with a focus on graphic design. I went to the Michael School and finished last year. I got the title DiS. Graphic Designer. Currently, I am here at VŠKK.
Also to graphics, I work on Czech floorball development projects. I am an active referee and player... well, not active right now due to my health problems. So, if I'm not sitting at the computer at home, I'm somewhere on the court... and I must not forget that I am a proud owner of a cat.

My projects: 

visual identity, posters, product design , logo design


Divadelní klub Školka

"Theatrical club Nursery"

This project has nothing to do with the nursery; it's just a coincidence of the name.

This project was created in 2018 as part of a competition for the visual identity of a theater club. The design I made won and was used. It's still used today. I like remembering it because it was my first big contest win that actually happened.


International music festival

This project was once again part of a competition, which I won. It involves creating the visual identity for an international classical music festival in Kutná Hora. The primary focus of this project is the creation of posters.


Chaoidy Paní Papouškové 

"Chaoid's of Mrs. Parrots"

This book covers the history of art by Mrs. Vaculíková from prehistoric times to the present. In the book, you will find education materials, including illustrations and interesting facts... And this is my final project on Michael's school. 

Law office 

This project is about a law firm. It is about visual identity.
