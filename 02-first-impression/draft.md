### About me
* Hello, my name is Klára Svobodová, and my nickname is Klárys. I have been doing graphic design since high school. I graduated from a vocational school with a focus on graphic design. I went to the Michael School and finished last year. I got the title DiS. Graphic Designer. Currently, I am here at VŠKK.
* Also to graphics, I work on Czech floorball development projects to stay sane. I am an active referee and player... well, not active right now due to my health problems. So, if I'm not sitting at the computer at home, I'm somewhere on the court.
