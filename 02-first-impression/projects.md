### DIVADELNÍ KLUB ŠKOLKA
"Theatrical club Nursery"

* This project has nothing to do with the nursery; it's just a coincidence of the name.
* Identity was created in 2018 as part of a competition for the visual identity of a theater club.
* The design I made won and was used. It's still used today. I like remembering it because it was my first bigger contest win that actually happened.

### INTERNATIONAL MUSIC FESTIVAL 
* This project was created in 2021. It was a part of a competition, which I won.
* It involves creating the visual identity for an international classical music festival in Kutná Hora.
* The primary focus of this project is the creation of posters.
* I wanted to incorporate the dynamics of music into the design.
* Use a color scheme that will be constant while also being able to change according to the given season.
* But if you see a similar poster here in the hallway... it's not my work, it's the work of the graphic artist who messed everything up.
* Overall, I don't really like these competitions because when someone else gets hold of your work, it usually turns into something nobody wants.

### CHAOIDY PANÍ PAPOUŠKOVÉ 
"Chaoid's of Mrs. Parrot"

* This book is about the history of art by Mrs. Vaculíková from prehistoric times to the present.
* In the book, you will find education materials, illustrations and interesting facts about some artist... And it was my final project on Michael's school last year.

### LAW OFFICE
* Project is about a law company.
* I created visual identity.
* It was a good experience in this sector.
* For this project, it was necessary to look at it from a perspective other than just the creative one but also consider other aspects.
* It was more contemplative.
