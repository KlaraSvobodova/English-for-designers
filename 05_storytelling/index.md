# Storytelling 

- I have decided to write more information about the topics I am addressing in my bachelor's thesis. I find them important for human society and the environment. It's good to be informed about them. These are topics that are more specialized, making it difficult to discuss them in my native language, let alone in English and specialized terms. I tried to explain it in a way that's easy to understand and not too boring.

## Animal Abuse in Industrial Research

Animal testing is when substances or products are tested on animals to see if they're safe or effective for humans and the environment. This testing happens in many areas, like medicine, cosmetics, and food.

The aim of animal testing is to find out if things are safe and work well, trying to keep people and the environment safe. But many people have concerns about this, thinking it's not right for animals to suffer, and that the results might not always apply to humans. Because of this, new methods are being developed to reduce or stop using animals.

Laws about animal testing should move towards reducing and ideally stopping it. The focus should be on supporting other testing methods. Laws should set clear rules for when animal testing can happen, only when there's no other choice and it's needed for important reasons. Research and drug companies should share details about the animals they use and why they test. It's also important to back research into new testing methods and make sure they follow ethical rules to reduce animal suffering. Educating people about these issues and supporting better alternatives can help reduce animal testing and improve animal welfare.


## Gender-Based Inequality in the Labor Market

Unequal pay is a complicated issue with many factors involved, making it hard to understand fully. These factors affect people's lives and society in big ways, even if we can't always see them clearly.

Gender stereotypes are a big part of unequal pay. People sometimes think certain jobs are better suited for men, leading to unfair pay. These views also impact how rewards are given out. Women often do unpaid work at home, which isn't counted in economic numbers. This can make them rely on others financially and limit their job opportunities, widening the pay gap. Discrimination based on gender, age, or ethnicity also plays a role in unequal pay.

Being a parent or facing other life challenges can also affect pay. People might have ideas about how being a parent could affect someone's job performance. These hidden connections impact not just individuals but also society as a whole.

Traditional views on gender roles still exist, with men seen as providers and women as caregivers. People often think women aren't suited for leadership roles due to perceived lack of motivation or because they might have family commitments. To make the job market more equal, laws and policies need to change. This includes ensuring equal pay and transparency, offering equal job opportunities and promotions (like quotas for women), providing equal parental leave and childcare options for both parents, protecting against discrimination and harassment, supporting flexible work options, and helping balance work and family life. Investing in education and awareness programs to challenge stereotypes and promote equality is crucial. These changes should be monitored and supported by broader societal and political efforts to create a fairer, more balanced work environment.

## Support for Local Sustainable Agriculture

Traditional farming often uses chemicals like pesticides and fertilizers to get the most crops in the shortest time. Sustainable farming, on the other hand, focuses on using organic fertilizers. In this type of farming, chemicals are not allowed, and natural methods without synthetic pesticides are used to protect and feed plants. Artificial hormones to speed up plant growth are also avoided.

Sustainable farming aims to disturb the soil as little as possible, using fewer machines. When adding things like fertilizers and chemicals, the goal is not to harm the natural processes in the soil. This helps promote diversity in plants and improves how water and nutrients are used, leading to better crop yields in the long run.

The principles of sustainable farming can be used anywhere and adapt to local conditions. The focus remains on minimizing soil disturbance and using external inputs thoughtfully to protect the soil's natural processes.

Sustainable farming encourages good farming practices and better soil management, especially for crops watered naturally or with artificial irrigation. Along with other practices like using quality seeds and managing pests, weeds, and water, sustainable farming is vital for making agriculture more sustainable. It also allows for blending different farming types, like mixing tree and pasture farming.

Laws about farming should support more sustainable methods. This means offering financial incentives and tax breaks for farms that go organic. Laws should protect soil and water from harm by agricultural chemicals. Rules on using chemical fertilizers and pesticides should be tighter to lessen their environmental impact. Encouraging crop variety and genetic diversity is also important for more resilient farming systems. Supporting smaller farms can help with this and also protect biodiversity. Waste management and using renewable energy on farms should be promoted too. Laws could also boost local markets and short supply chains, cutting down on transport emissions and supporting local economies. Educating farmers and backing innovations in sustainable farming are essential. These changes could help make farming more sustainable and resilient, benefiting the environment and people's health. It's crucial these changes are made with farmers' needs in mind and with input from everyone in the farming sector.
