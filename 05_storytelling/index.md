## Animal Abuse in Industrial Research

Animal testing is a process in which various substances, products, or procedures are tested on live animals to assess their safety, efficacy, or potential risks to humans and the environment. This type of testing is utilized across various fields, including pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, food, medicine, toxicology, and environmental research.

The goal of animal testing is to obtain relevant information about the safety and efficacy of substances or procedures, and potentially minimize risks to human health and the environment. However, this approach is controversial, as many people raise ethical and moral concerns regarding the suffering of animals and question the translatability of test results to human conditions. As a result, alternative testing methods are emerging, aiming to minimize or completely replace the use of animals.

Changes in laws concerning animal testing should aim towards gradual restriction and ideally banning of this practice. One of the main directions is the strengthening and support of alternative testing methods. Laws should establish strict criteria for conducting tests on animals, ensuring they are carried out only in necessary cases where no other suitable alternative is available, and when there are strong scientific reasons for animal testing. Transparency in research institutions and the pharmaceutical industry should be mandatory, including the disclosure of information about the animals used and the purposes of testing. Furthermore, it is important to support research and development of alternative testing methods through financial and institutional backing. Ethical standards and oversight to ensure compliance with these standards should be strengthened to minimize animal suffering. A crucial part is also educating the public about the issues associated with animal testing and promoting proven alternatives. In this way, animal testing could gradually decrease, and the protection of their rights and well-being could increase.


## Gender-Based Inequality in the Labor Market

Unequal pay is a complex issue, the causes and impacts of which are not always evident and often intertwined with invisible connections. These connections cannot be easily quantified, yet they profoundly affect individuals' quality of life and the functioning of society as a whole.

Gender stereotypes play a crucial role in unequal pay. Beliefs that certain positions are more suitable for men than for women can lead to discrimination in salary aspects. This stereotypical view of roles in the workplace also influences the distribution of rewards. Unpaid domestic work, often performed by women, is another factor. This work is not included in economic indicators, which can lead to financial dependence on a partner and limited access to paid work, deepening pay gaps. Discrimination based on gender, age, or ethnicity affects pay and access to opportunities in the labor market, further exacerbating pay inequalities.

Motherhood and other life situations can also influence pay. Perceptions of how motherhood or other life situations may affect job performance. These more or less invisible connections not only affect individuals and households but also have significant impacts on overall societal stability and development.

At the same time, traditional gender stereotypes persist, where men are perceived as family breadwinners and women as caregivers. It is generally assumed that women are not suitable for leadership positions due to presumed lower motivation or work commitment limitations due to motherhood. To achieve gender balance in the labor market, it is essential to make changes in laws and policies that influence the work environment. Key areas include pay equality and wage transparency, equal opportunities in recruitment and promotions including the introduction of quotas for women, the right to parental leave and child care on equal terms for both parents, legal protection against discrimination and sexual harassment, support for flexible working conditions, and balancing work and family life, including providing accessible childcare services and promoting men's involvement in family care. Additionally, it is important to invest in educational and awareness-raising programs focused on combating stereotypes and prejudices in the gender field and supporting equal opportunities for men and women in the labor market. These changes should be accompanied by appropriate implementation and monitoring measures and should be supported by broader societal and political initiatives. Such measures could contribute to creating a fairer and more gender-balanced work environment.

## Support for Local Sustainable Agriculture

While traditional agriculture often utilizes chemicals as pesticides and fertilizers to achieve maximum yields in the shortest time possible, sustainable agriculture prioritizes organic fertilizers. In organic farming, these chemicals are entirely banned, and natural substances without synthetic pesticides are used for plant protection and fertilization. Similarly, artificial hormones to accelerate plant growth are not employed.

Mechanical interventions in the soil are minimized or entirely eliminated, and external inputs, such as fertilizers and chemicals, are applied with consideration not to harm biological processes in the soil. This approach promotes biodiversity and natural processes in the soil, leading to more efficient water and nutrient utilization and improving long-term crop production.

The principles of sustainable agriculture are applicable in any agricultural landscape and utilize locally adapted practices. Mechanical interventions in the soil are minimized or entirely eliminated, and external inputs, such as fertilizers and chemicals, are applied with consideration not to harm biological processes in the soil.

Sustainable agriculture promotes proper agronomy and improves overall soil management, particularly concerning production irrigated by natural rainfall or artificial irrigation. Along with other proven practices, such as using quality seeds and integrated pest management, fertilization, weed, and water control, sustainable agriculture is a key factor for sustainable agricultural production intensification. This method also opens possibilities for integrating various production sectors, such as combining tree and pasture farming into agricultural landscapes.

Changes in laws related to agriculture should aim to support more sustainable practices. This includes promoting organic farming through financial incentives and tax breaks for farms practicing organic methods. Laws should also protect soil and water resources from degradation and contamination by agricultural chemicals. Regulations on the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides should be strengthened to reduce negative environmental impacts. Crop diversification and support for genetic diversity should also be encouraged for more resilient and sustainable agricultural systems. Supporting small and medium-sized farms could play a crucial role in sustainable agriculture and biodiversity preservation. Waste management and the use of renewable energy sources on farms should also be promoted. Laws could support local markets and short supply chains, reducing transport-related emissions and bolstering local economies. A crucial component should be educating farmers and supporting innovations for sustainable agriculture. These changes could contribute to creating more sustainable and resilient agricultural systems that better protect the environment and improve people's health and well-being. It is important that these changes are implemented considering farmers' needs and in collaboration with all agricultural sector stakeholders.
