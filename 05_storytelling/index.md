# Animal Abuse in Industrial Research

- Animal testing is a process in which various substances, products, or procedures are tested on live animals to assess their safety, efficacy, or potential risks to humans and the environment. This type of testing is utilized across various fields, including pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, food, medicine, toxicology, and environmental research.

The goal of animal testing is to obtain relevant information about the safety and efficacy of substances or procedures, and potentially minimize risks to human health and the environment. However, this approach is controversial, as many people raise ethical and moral concerns regarding the suffering of animals and question the translatability of test results to human conditions. As a result, alternative testing methods are emerging, aiming to minimize or completely replace the use of animals.

Changes in laws concerning animal testing should aim towards gradual restriction and ideally banning of this practice. One of the main directions is the strengthening and support of alternative testing methods. Laws should establish strict criteria for conducting tests on animals, ensuring they are carried out only in necessary cases where no other suitable alternative is available, and when there are strong scientific reasons for animal testing. Transparency in research institutions and the pharmaceutical industry should be mandatory, including the disclosure of information about the animals used and the purposes of testing. Furthermore, it is important to support research and development of alternative testing methods through financial and institutional backing. Ethical standards and oversight to ensure compliance with these standards should be strengthened to minimize animal suffering. A crucial part is also educating the public about the issues associated with animal testing and promoting proven alternatives. In this way, animal testing could gradually decrease, and the protection of their rights and well-being could increase.
