# Final thesis
## Non-profit organization We are fair
The final thesis focuses on outlining the programming of the "We are fair in the future" initiative and establishing communication strategies for new topics. 

## Concept

## Target of campaign
The aim of the bachelor's thesis is to preserve and develop the concept of fairness, which can be applied to other topics in the coming years. Additionally, the focus will be on creating a brand that would represent the company and enable individuals, products, or organizations to present themselves as fair actors.

The task will involve analyzing the current situation and defining areas where the principles of fairness can be applied. Furthermore, it will address the exploration of competitive organizations and identifying opportunities for expanding the concept into new segments. It will also include methods that enable understanding the needs and expectations of stakeholders.

## Other topics
1. Animal abuse in industrial research.
Animal testing is a process in which various substances, products, or procedures are tested on live animals to assess their safety, efficacy, or potential risks to humans or the environment. This type of testing is used in many fields, including pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, food industry, medicine, toxicology, and environmental research.

3. Gender-based inequality in the labor market.
Unequal pay is a complex issue, the causes and impacts of which are not always apparent and often linked to invisible connections. These connections cannot be easily measured numerically; however, they have a profound impact on the quality of life for individuals and the functioning of society as a whole.

5. Support for local sustainable agriculture.
Changes in laws related to agriculture should aim to support more sustainable practices. This includes promoting organic farming through financial incentives and tax breaks for farms that practice organic methods. Laws should also protect soil and water resources from degradation and contamination by agricultural chemicals. Regulation of the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides should be strengthened to reduce negative impacts on the environment. Crop diversification and support for genetic diversity should also be encouraged for more resilient and sustainable agricultural systems.

## Target group
Target audience is divided into three parts: 
1. General public
Where the main ambition of this strategy is not only to raise awareness about the issue at hand but also to gain support and engagement from those who have not previously been interested in or had much information about this issue.
3. Informed and engaged public
This group is motivated by emotional aspects of the topic, which is a key factor in building support. Emotions have a significant impact on how individuals perceive and react to certain issues and can be a strong source for changing public opinion.
4. Professional public in the field of legislation and public administration
For this group, the key is the presentation of expert information and substantiated facts. The campaign content should be backed by data and analyses. The goal is to adjust laws to reflect principles of justice and fairness.
