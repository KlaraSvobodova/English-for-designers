# Year in review

- I think this year has been the fastest of all! Everything went by so quickly that I don't even know where or with whom to start.

## School

School was quite a ride this year; I've been working on my bachelor's thesis and trying to finish everything needed for the completion of this semester. I'm looking forward to the end of the school year. After the last two years with final projects in the last two grades, it's time to take a break from thesis works and focus on something else as well. I'm currently contemplating whether to continue studying or enter the workforce.

## Work

This year, I worked on an interesting project, which was creating a brand for a cosmetic brand. It involved professional hair care products mainly designed for hairdressers. It was a valuable experience for me in a different industry, and I hope the product will be successful and sell well. Currently, we are working on the second phase of this project.

## Life

Over the past 12 months, I've been dealing with various health issues constantly. At the beginning of October, I had a minor car accident and struggled with back problems after the impact... when that was finally getting better, I injured my Achilles tendon during a floorball match by sliding my leg against the net behind the goal. So, I was on crutches for almost 3 months and then went through rehabilitation. Fortunately, everything seems to be okay now, and I'll be able to return to what I like.

## Floorball
In floorball, we had several tournaments, including the Superfinal day, where there were almost 14,000 people at the O2 Arena.
